    <h1>Ranger</h1>
    <p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees
      , hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching
      a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one
      enemy after another.</p>

      <h1>Wizard</h1>
        <p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the
           spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates
            the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning,
            subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
             monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or
             turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one
             substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open
             portals to other worlds. </p>

     <h1>Paladin </h1>
     <p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime
        of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands
         on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the manâ€™s
          wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.
